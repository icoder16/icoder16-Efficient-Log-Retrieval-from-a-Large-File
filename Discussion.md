For processing log files, different methods have their own advantages and trade-offs. 

Simple line-by-line reading is suitable for moderate-sized logs (a few GBs) as it has minimal memory usage and is easy to implement, though it can be slower for very large files. 

Buffered reading (readlines() in chunks) is a better option for large files as it reduces I/O overhead, but it slightly increases memory usage. 

Memory-mapped files (mmap) work best for huge files (100+ GB) since they offer super-fast performance and avoid RAM overhead, but they only work with local files. 

Finally, parallel processing (multiprocessing) is ideal for servers with multiple CPU cores, as it provides the fastest performance and scales well; however, it is more complex and requires disk seek logic.
